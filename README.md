# AerialReconnaissance

Aerial reconnaissance. A conditional map is created in the form of a matrix, the dimension of which determines the size of the map containing an arbitrary number of units (goals) in arbitrary cells. From an arbitrary point on the map, several scouts (streams) start, the courses of which are selected so as to cover the maximum area of the map. Each scout records the targets whose coordinates coincide with its coordinates and, upon reaching the map boundaries, reports the number of detected targets.
